# ORIGINAL TALK

[Internal Developer Platform Reference Architecture For Red Hat Openshift - Raffaele Spazzoli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4f-ymzQkc4)

# IDEAS
- Standardization and automation are essential for solving developer efficiency issues in large organizations.
- Infrastructure teams must now prioritize the developer experience alongside building scalable infrastructure.
- A seamless onboarding process simplifies and improves all subsequent developer platform processes.
- Balancing fast local code execution with production-similar environments is key to developer productivity.
- Effective CI/CD pipelines require streamlined code-to-production processes with minimal manual intervention.
- Observability and automated monitoring should be integral to any developer platform's capabilities.
- Platform building is a complex integration exercise involving many tools and processes.
- Asymptotic scaling of processes ensures sustainability and cost-effectiveness in platform development.
- Golden paths provide standardized, direct routes to production without restricting developers' creativity.
- The Humanitec platform acts as glue logic, simplifying integration and deployment on OpenShift.
- Developer portals like Developer Hub centralize tools and simplify access through plugin systems.
- Humanitec's approach to golden paths allows ongoing updates and standardization improvements.
- Humanitec's simple language, Score, defines high-level workload needs for developers.
- Resource definitions allow platform engineers to specify deployable building blocks for workloads.
- Collaboration between Humanitec and Red Hat enables streamlined development platform creation.

# INSIGHTS
- Developer experience is crucial for innovation, cost management, and market speed in organizations.
- Infrastructure teams must evolve into platform engineering teams focusing on developer ease.
- Onboarding is pivotal; a seamless start simplifies all downstream developer platform activities.
- Balancing rapid local execution with production-like environments enhances developer productivity.
- Observability should be a default capability in all developer platforms for effective monitoring.
- Building platforms requires integrating diverse tools and establishing efficient, scalable processes.
- Golden paths offer pre-designed, standardized routes to production, enhancing developer autonomy.
- Humanitec's glue logic simplifies platform integration and deployment on OpenShift environments.
- Developer portals consolidate tools and provide easy access via extensible plugin systems.
- Ongoing updates to golden paths ensure developers stay current with organizational standards.

# QUOTES
- "The developer experience for our developers...is often not very good, sometimes really miserable."
- "The answer is typically with more standardization and more automation."
- "The flow of developing...should be easy, simple, and seamless for the developers."
- "Onboarding...is the first impression that you get on the platform."
- "We have to find a way to make that experience work well also including the dependencies."
- "Observability out of the box...should be part of the capabilities that our platform gives us."
- "Building a platform is a large integration exercise with many tools."
- "We are in a large migration...to new containers."
- "The solution is standardization, automation, and self-servicing."
- "Golden paths provide a direct way to production for our software."
- "Humanitec...simplifies that large integration exercise."
- "Score is our workflow definition...the only thing developers need to learn to use Humanitec."
- "Developer Hub...brings together...all the tools used by developers."
- "Humanitec allows staying current with the standardization that your organization is deciding."
- "We can enable the concept of golden path."
