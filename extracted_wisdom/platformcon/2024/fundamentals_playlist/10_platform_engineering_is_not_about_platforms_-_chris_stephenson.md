## ORIGINAL TALK

[Platform Engineering Is Not About Platforms - Chris Stephenson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVi8jfuCPw8).

## IDEAS

- Platform engineering is not just about platforms but delivering commodity components and services.
- Software engineering remains in the master craftsman phase, requiring deep, broad knowledge.
- Commodification in other industries reduces costs and increases efficiency through standardization.
- Master craftsmen in other industries are rare due to commodification and scalability.
- Commodities are interchangeable goods or services, priced independently of their source.
- Commodification examples include electricity, internet access, and electronic payments.
- Commodification in software includes Kubernetes services and database services like PostgreSQL.
- Cloud commodification eases software development by standardizing components.
- Platforms provide commodity services or goods, reducing cognitive load and time.
- Supermarkets are platforms, offering a wide range of commodities for daily needs.
- Platform engineering focuses on providing commodity components efficiently, unlike DevOps.
- DevOps integrates development and operations through automation and shared ownership.
- Platform engineering commodifies shared ownership areas, enhancing DevOps practices.
- Platforms in engineering are like wood in woodworking; they're means to an end.
- Building platforms is a skill, but delivering commodities is the ultimate goal.
- Commodification reduces cognitive load, dependence on individuals, and low standardization.
- Electric cars face platform engineering challenges like finding charging points.
- Platform engineering can address broad software development challenges.
- Commodification of cloud services like Kubernetes makes development more effective.
- Commodities in software mean focusing on core functionality, not specific implementations.
- Platform engineering enhances software development by providing interchangeable components.
- Platforms rely on a network, like petrol stations or supermarkets, for consistent service.
- Platform engineering should aim for efficient commodity delivery, not just platform creation.
- Commodification in software allows developers to focus on building solutions, not infrastructure.
- Platform engineering's goal is to streamline processes, reducing development complexities.
- Supermarkets as platforms minimize cognitive load by offering diverse commodities in one place.

## INSIGHTS
