The speaker at Platform Con discusses transitioning fragile internal platforms to antifragile ones by demonstrating their business value and understanding economic cycles.

## ORIGINAL TALK

[From Fragile To Antifragile Internal Platforms - Manuel Pais](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5Yv3bNRXWg).

## IDEAS

- Internal platforms often have clear costs but unclear revenue, unlike end products.
- Platforms should reduce cognitive load for streamlined teams, despite challenges in measuring it.
- The tool "Temperature" aims to assess drivers of cognitive load, not directly measure it.
- Demonstrating platform value to business stakeholders is crucial for antifragility.
- Adidas's platform engineering frees product teams to focus on experimentation, boosting innovation.
- Platforms need long-term investment to serve as engines for growth and new revenue.
- Economic cycles affect platform sustainability; understanding them can guide expectations and decisions.
- Platforms often fail to articulate their organizational value, leading to fragility.
- Antifragility involves thriving amid stressors, shocks, and volatility, as described by Nassim Taleb.
- Unhappy internal customers weaken platforms; understanding their dissatisfaction is vital.
- Quantifying the platform's direct business impact, though challenging, is essential.
- Decision-makers may lack awareness of platform value, risking funding cuts.
- Four pillars for platform sustainability: trust, success stories, internal confidence, and external confidence.
- Platform trust requires consistent decision-making, visibility, and responsiveness.
- Success stories should highlight qualitative platform value across the organization.
- Internal confidence relies on metrics like adoption, satisfaction, and reliability.
- External confidence requires profit-loss metrics, ROI, and cost control.
- Speaking the business's language, like Adidas, can bridge platform-business understanding.
- CFOs need concrete data on platform-supported revenue, not just adoption metrics.
- Platform success stories should demonstrate clear business impacts, like reduced cloud costs.
- Measure platform value to justify its existence and future investment.
- Understand business cycles and organizational incentives for platform funding.
- Platforms should show ROI and forecast future value scenarios.
- Fragile platforms are vulnerable during economic turbulence; antifragility is essential.
- Strategic value across stakeholders is key to platform success.
- Training and resources can guide building trust and measuring platform value.

## INSIGHTS

- Quantifying business impact and ROI is crucial for platform sustainability and funding.
- Trust and visibility are foundational for platform success and organizational alignment.
