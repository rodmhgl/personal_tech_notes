# SUMMARY

Mallorie, Director of Customer Success at Humanite Tech, discusses the Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) framework and its implementation.

## ORIGINAL TALK

[Minimum Viable : A Proven Success Framework To Kick Off Your Platform Engineering Initiative - Mallory Haigh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZClrWnyUdg).

## IDEAS

- Minimum viable platforms (MVPs) quickly demonstrate platform engineering initiatives' value using a structured, outcome-focused approach.
- Identify a pioneering developer team to lead innovation and build the minimum viable platform around them.
- MVPs exclude production environments initially, focusing on nonproduction requirements for pioneering teams.
- Develop a product-like roadmap for platform iteration and growth within the organization.
- Engage influential stakeholders like security, data, and finance to support platform engineering initiatives.
- MVPs allow scaling within organizations without overwhelming technical teams with complexity.
- MVPs should be representative, repeatable, and iterative, reflecting common tech estate resources.
- Build MVPs using common systems, applications, and regularities to ensure representativeness.
- MVPs provide a foundation for continuous iteration and onboarding additional teams.
- Think of MVPs as a starting point, emphasizing continuous improvement and iteration.
- The four MVP phases: Discovery, Integration, Deployment, and Adoption, guide project management.
- Discovery phase focuses on technical outcomes, golden paths, and project management alignment.
- Integration phase involves building platform infrastructure and connecting components.
- Deployment phase includes implementing representative applications and testing end-to-end flows.
- Adoption phase focuses on growth strategies, demo creation, and diverse audience engagement.
- Avoid common pitfalls: complexity, tool obsession, user neglect, and narrow developer focus.
- Emphasize solving problems, user focus, and productivity impact in platform development.
- Developer experience encompasses broader stakeholder considerations, not just developers.
- Beyond MVP, consider production readiness and full-scale adoption using a cyclical process.
- Adoption planning involves defining objectives, prioritizing teams, and internal communication.
- Successful adoption requires a model for moving towards full-scale platform integration.
- Platform engineering philosophy offers a low-risk entry into solving organizational tech challenges.
- A cyclical, iterative process aids in evolving platforms based on feedback and needs.
- Adoption planning's five steps: define objectives, prioritize cohorts, discover requirements, communicate.
- MVP development should focus on building a scalable, representative, and iterative foundation.
- Engage stakeholders to ensure platform engineering initiatives align with organizational goals.
- MVPs should balance technical excellence with user-centric design and stakeholder engagement.
- Successful platform engineering requires innovation, stakeholder engagement, and continuous iteration.
- Platform engineering philosophy encourages doing new things to achieve unprecedented results.
- MVPs enable organizations to enter new spaces with reduced risk and increased problem-solving capabilities.

## INSIGHTS

- MVPs provide a structured, low-risk approach to implementing platform engineering initiatives effectively.
- Engaging diverse stakeholders ensures platform engineering aligns with broader organizational goals.
- Continuous improvement and iteration are essential for successful platform engineering implementation.
- MVPs focus on solving problems and creating value, not just on technical excellence.
- Platform engineering requires innovation and a willingness to embrace new approaches.
- User-centric design and stakeholder engagement are crucial for successful platform engineering.
- MVPs allow for scalable growth and adaptation within organizations without overwhelming complexity.
- Adopting a cyclical, iterative process aids in evolving platforms based on feedback and needs.
- Prioritizing user needs and productivity impact leads to more effective platform solutions.
- Platform engineering philosophy offers a new way to solve organizational tech challenges.

## QUOTES

- "MVPs are a way to show the value of your platform engineering initiative very quickly."
- "Identify a pioneering developer team that can lead the way on Innovation."
- "We don't touch production environments inside of MVPs and it's very important to understand that."
- "MVPs should be three things: representative, repeatable, and iterative."
- "Iteration is innovation and just kind of thinking about it that way makes it a lot easier."
- "Discovery phase focuses on reviewing technical outcomes and aligning project management teams."
- "Integration phase involves building platform infrastructure and connecting components together."
- "Deployment phase includes implementing representative applications and testing end-to-end flows."
- "Adoption phase focuses on growth strategies, demo creation, and engaging diverse audiences."
- "Avoid having to win over every single technical team immediately with MVPs."
- "Continuous improvement and iteration are essential for successful platform engineering."
- "Developer experience isn't just about developers; it's about many other stakeholders."
- "Platform engineering is a game-changing philosophy inside the space."
- "Successful adoption requires a model for moving towards full-scale platform integration."
- "Platform engineering encourages doing new things to achieve unprecedented results."

## HABITS
