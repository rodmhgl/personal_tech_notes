# Michael Levan - The Platform Engineering Book - Part 1: The Why

While Platform Engineering is boarding the hype train, the majority of people aren't 100% sure what it is.

Platform Engineering is the creation and management of integrated capabilities that are implemented according to what the platform user needs (the platform user being the internal engineer/developer using the platform) via self-service capabilities.

Platform Engineering isn't new, it just hasn't been its own team or focus point. It's oddly in the middle of being an emerging, yet old practice. It is treating internal engineering as a product within itself.

In a "you-wrote-it-you-run-it" setting, everyone is expected to be an expert in all areas of the platform and that is simply not possible. There must be some type of separation of concern and the ability reduce cognitive load. We need dedicated engineers that are as close to an expert as possible in the engineering stack and the tools associated with them. These engineers are the Platform Engineers.

It is the Platform Engineers job to be as close to an expert as possible in everything from designing the platform to the creation and management of the platform and ensuring services are running as expected.

## Why Do We Care

Platform Engineering is about making the lives of internal engineers better. It's about making sure the engineering/tech/dev teams have what they need without banging their head against a wall.

The idea is to hand the internal teams a platform on a golden platter so the only thing for them to worry about is deploying the application.

## When to implement

An organization should begin to consider Platform Engineering once internal teams are getting swamped with multiple requests that are pulling them in separate directions and separation of concern questions are coming into play.

Alternatively, consider Platform Engineering simply if you want a dedicated engineering department to develop self-service capabilities.
