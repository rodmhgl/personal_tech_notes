# Michael Levan - The Platform Engineering Book - Part 2: The Planning

## Understanding Business Values

The "why" behind creating a platform is more critical than the technology itself and it is critical for Platform Engineers to understand this "why".

Planning, architecture, and design (not tools) solve tech problems. Tools simply help accomplish the plan.

Tooling decisions are best made at the engineering level because it is the engineers who understand how to solve the problem and, therefore, which tool makes sense.

Platform Engineers must be able to uniquely identify a problem and understand how to solve that problem efficiently and effectively. Management and leadership teams are not concerned with technology or tooling, they care about the "why" and the positive outcomes.

Talk with teams to understand what solutions they need from you to solve their problems. Once you understand the value you need to create, the solution will become obvious.

## Play Nicely with Others

While Platform Engineering may not be a public-facing role, you'll still be working closely with your customers - internal development and engineering teams.

### Development Teams

The goal of Platform Engineering should be to remove the cognitive load from developers and implement a proper separation of concerns.

Platform Engineering teams should work to fully understand what developers need to get their job done. Listen to the teams to understand what they need and engineer an implementation that works for development teams.

### Product Managers

It may be a wise idea to have a Project Manager (with a technical background) in place on the Platform Engineering team to protect the engineers from managerial tasks.

### Dedicated Platform Engineering Team

A dedicated Platform Engineering team is preferred, 5-7 people in size. All will work on all portions of the platform, but each will have a strength.

## Standardization

Standardization is necessary for a successful Platform Engineering practice. A standardization should be made around the stack your organization is using and what goes into that stack.

The number one way to ensure a deployment doesn't go as expected is by not introducing a standard.

## Tech Skills

Overall, a Platform Engineer must know the Cloud and Kubernetes, that's a given, but also networking, operating systems, infrastructure, and all the fundamental elements of computing associated with those items.

## Who does what

Overall, the responsibility of operation of the platform goes to the Platform Engineers or to self-service capabilities created by the Platform Engineers.
