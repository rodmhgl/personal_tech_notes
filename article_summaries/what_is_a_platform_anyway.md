# Overview

A platform is a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling internal product. Autonomous delivery teams can make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced co-ordination.

## What Makes a Platform Compelling

- Self-service for the overwhelming majority of use cases.
- Composable, containing discrete services that can be used independently.
- Does not force an inflexible way of working upon the delivery team.
- Quick and cheap to start using, with an easy on-ramp (e.g. Quick start guides, documentation, code samples)
- Has a rich internal user community for sharing
- Secure and compliant by default
- Up to date

A platform ultimately becomes compelling when it is easier to consume than building and maintaining your own thing. Netflix calls their centralized tooling ‘the paved road’ - teams do not have to make use of the tooling but are responsible for all the costs of maintaining their own alternatives.

A platform is more than just software and APIs - it is documentation, consulting, support,  evangelism, templates, and guidelines.

## Backlog Coupling

Backlog coupling is when changes have dependencies across the backlogs of multiple teams. Backlogs get chained across the organization, each being prioritized according to a different system. This reliance on other teams results in enormous productivity and responsiveness losses.

At an Australian telecommunications company, a study was done of hundreds of pieces of work or tasks passing through a delivery center. The tasks that had to wait for another team were 10-12x slower in elapsed time, so dependencies have a real significant impact.

A good platform must provide services that do not require tickets to be raised and work to be assigned, therefore reducing backlog coupling.

Self-service is a key defining characteristic for a good platform. The platform should provide a team with self-service access. Specifically it should allow for self-service provisioning, self-service configuration, and self-service management and operation of the platform capabilities and assets.

## Gotchas

- An effective platform must answer how your delivery teams will quickly adopt the new capabilities, what choices will they make independently vs using sensible defaults, and how you will maintain the capabilities ongoing. This will require some internal consulting skills, training, and evangelism.
- Successful platforms start small and are based on genuine proven needs. Harvest proven solutions from application teams, and try joint-ventures to create and test capabilities with the teams that will use them.
