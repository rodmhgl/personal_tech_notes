# The 6 Pillars of Platform Engineering: Part 1 — Security

Platform engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering teams. These tools and workflows comprise the platform.

The goal of a platform team is to increase developer productivity, facilitate more frequent releases, improve application stability, lower security and compliance risks and reduce costs.

Two common themes among companies with great developer experiences:

- A standardized set of infrastructure services to reduce friction for developers and ops teams.
- A Platform as a Product practice.

Standardizing on a set of infrastructure services reduces friction for developers and operations teams and reduces tooling and process fragmentation, resulting in greater core stability for your software delivery systems and environments.

Unlike heritage IT projects, which typically have a finite start and end date, an internal developer platform is never truly finished. It will be developed on an iterative basis with ongoing tasks include backlog management, regular feature releases and roadmap updates to stakeholders.

Building and maintaining a platform involves continuous conversations and buy-in from developers (the platform team’s customers) and business stakeholders.

This set of articles functions as a starting point for those conversations by helping platform teams organize their product around six technical elements or “pillars” of the software delivery process along with the general requirements and workflow for each.
