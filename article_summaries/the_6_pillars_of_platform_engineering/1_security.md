# Part 1 — Security

An early focus on security promotes a secure-by-default platform experience.

As infrastructure becomes increasingly dynamic, companies are shifting from network perimeter-based security to identity-based security, identity-brokering solutions and modern security workflows, such as centralized management of credentials and encryption methodologies. This promotes visibility and consistent auditing practices while reducing operational overhead.

Leading companies have also adopted “shift-left” security; implementing security controls throughout the software development lifecycle.

This DevSecOps mindset requires tooling decisions that support modern identity-driven security to avoid ticket-driven processes.
